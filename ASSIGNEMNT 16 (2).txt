Creating Tables and Indexes.

1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.

create INDEX date_order ON orders(odate); 

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
be unique (assume all current values are unique)?

create unique index i_orders_onum on orders(onum);

ALTER TABLE orders add PRIMARY KEY(onum);


3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.


Create Index o_date ON orders(odate);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

create unique index i_customers_com on customers (rating);

ALTER TABLE customers add PRIMARY KEY(rating);
